Guitar Chords Recognition

Files are organized this way:
in the Code.zip you can find all the matlab code which consist in 3 main files and a some functions:

the SignalAnalisys.m is used for the analisys of the wav files and signal processing;

the Chord_Recognition.m is used for the binary classification between two chords, so you should make 2 folders:
the first containing the 40 wav files as Training Set, the second one with 10 wav files as Test Set
[you could use the files I have uploaded: for the TestSet TestFold.zip and for Training the 2 TraingFold1.zip
and TraingFold2.zip]

The Multiclass_ChRec.m is for the Multilabel classification, and you have to make again 2 folders:
Training 48 wav and Test 12 wav
[again, you could use as Test Set the Test_MC.zip and for the Training Set the 3 folders called
Training_MC1.zip, Training_MC2.zip, Training_MC3.zip]

( I'm sorry for this procedure but it was impossible to upload all the files alltogether because of 
their dimensions)
